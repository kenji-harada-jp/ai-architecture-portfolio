# AI / Backend System Portfolio

## 60-second Summary
Backend / Full-stack engineer with hands-on experience in
designing, implementing, and operating AI-enabled systems.

- Strong in **Django / Next.js-based backend systems**
- Experienced in **RAG-oriented system design and evaluation loops**
- Focus on **operability, explainability, and long-term maintenance**
- Able to handle **requirements → design → implementation → operation**

Looking for roles where I can contribute to
backend development, system design, and AI-enabled workflows.

## Core Skills
- Backend: Python (Django, FastAPI), SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
- Frontend / BFF: TypeScript, Next.js
- AI Systems: RAG design, rule-based scoring, evaluation & improvement loops
- Infrastructure / Ops: Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Cloud (GCP / Supabase)
- Focus areas: system reliability, explainable logic, operational safety

## Selected Case Studies

### Case 1: nands.tech (AI-enabled Platform)
**Role:** System Architect / Backend & Full-stack Engineer  
**Context:** Design and development of an AI-enabled platform from scratch.

**What I did**
- Designed system architecture covering frontend, backend, and data layer
- Implemented backend APIs and operational workflows using Django / Next.js
- Built RAG-based information retrieval and generation flows
- Designed evaluation and safety mechanisms to avoid unstable AI outputs

**Key decisions**
- Prioritized explainable logic over black-box ML models
- Focused on operational safety and long-term maintainability
- Designed systems assuming continuous improvement after release

**Outcome**
- Production-ready AI-enabled platform
- Stable operation with clear responsibility boundaries
- Architecture reusable for other AI-driven services

---

### Case 2: AI Automation System
**Role:** Backend Engineer / System Designer  
**Context:** Automation of business workflows using AI and external APIs.

**What I did**
- Designed API-driven automation workflows
- Implemented backend logic with clear failure handling and retries
- Focused on operational stability rather than experimental accuracy

**Key decisions**
- Avoided unnecessary ML complexity
- Used rule-based and deterministic logic where reliability mattered
- Designed workflows that non-engineers could operate safely

**Outcome**
- Reduced manual workload through automation
- Stable operation without frequent human intervention
- Easy-to-maintain system structure

---

## What I Can Contribute
- Backend development with Django / Python
- System design focusing on operability and safety
- AI-enabled features that can be **explained, evaluated, and improved**
- Collaboration with frontend, PM, and non-technical stakeholders
